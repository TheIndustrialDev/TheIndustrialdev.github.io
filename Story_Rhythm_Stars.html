            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>Truthspeaker, also known as Duncan Visser, was a popular Rhythm Star who eventually went undercover. Originally, Duncan was an average rhythm star, performing records and concerts based on city-wide topics. Duncan was well respected upon everyone until Ugo Vondez formed a plan against him. This resulted in Duncan being forced to go against the law to bring order to Modum city. Before the disaster, Duncan donated a lot of his funding to charities across the city. However, after Duncan was forced to go rogue, he uses all the money to fund his concerts, having the Boisson Cachee and Oliver collect the materials he could not obtain himself. Duncan is also the founder of the group Tempo Riot, a Rhythm Star concert group dedicated to shedding the light to the people on the truth of several topics sprawling around the city.</p><p><strong>Duncan's Start</strong></p><p>Ever since he was a young kid growing out in the outskirts of Mogum City, Duncan Visser was a huge fan of the music industry. Although he was a fan of all song artists, Duncan had a particular interest in rock. Duncan also developed a strong addiction to Bloxy Cola even in his early ages. During school, Duncan would often times perform songs he hand-wrote in the middle of the cafeteria. One day, during his high school years, the CEO of Noten Record Studios, Winston Hass, began searching for teenagers to potentially bring into the music industry. Winston specifically went to the music classes looking for people, but he found nobody of interest. As he was about to leave the complex, Winston heard Duncan performing a new song in the outdoor cafeteria area. Winston was almost instantly attracted to the music and saw Duncan as having potential in the industry. This is how Duncan’s career as a musical artist got all started up.</p><p><strong>Duncan's Career Jump</strong></p><p>At the start of his career, Duncan only new how to sing: he wasn’t into much of the dancing profession. Because of this, Winston Hass hired Gabriel Vos to teach Duncan how to dance to the beat of his songs. Gabriel was surprised at how fast Duncan was getting used to the performance style, even comparing Duncan’s skills to his own. Believing Duncan to be ready, Winston had Duncan perform his first “concert” at a small local amphitheater outside of Modum City. During the performance, Duncan played and danced to some of the songs he had written in previous years, with the instrumentals being done by staff members of Noten Record Studios. Amazingly, the concert was a huge success, with Duncan’s song “The Spoiled Matriarch”, which was focused around the government and its history of bribery, being the most popular of his songs.</p><p><strong>The Overhearing</strong></p><p>Duncan began writing new songs after that point, mostly about controversial topics, donating 30% of all the funds to charities related to the songs. One of these songs was “Freedom of the Pop”, a song released shortly after the plans to ban Bloxy Cola were announced. Following the ban of Bloxy Cola, Duncan secretly began buying the soda from Oliver Prins Jr., a middle school friend of Duncan who stole Bloxy Cola from hidden Boisson Cachee stashes. Eventually, Winston began rushing Duncan to get more songs out as fast as possible to boost up “his company’s profits”, leading Duncan to suspect Winston was out for the money more than anything. After this point, Duncan began writing controversial songs related to Modum City itself. One of these songs, titled “Snake of Modum”, was a song themed off of government corruption, secretly based on the actions of its mayor, Ugo Vondez. Upon the song’s release, Ugo spoke with Winston Hass telling him to make new rules for Duncan’ songs. Winston disagreed to do this, as Duncan was his biggest profit-making “asset” because of his controversial songs. Ugo then pledges to deal with the problem himself if Winston didn’t do something about it.  Duncan overhears the conversation and begins to realize he is nothing more to Winston than a moneybag.</p><p><strong>The Blackmail</strong></p><p>As expected, Winston did nothing about it. One day, however, Winston accidentally discovered Bloxy Cola cans in Duncan’s recording office. Two days later, Duncan made claims that had plans to go his own route. However, after hearing this, Winston threatened to report Duncan’s illegal possession of Bloxy Cola to the police if Duncan left Noten studios. This was the final push Duncan needed to learn that he was simply a pawn in Winston’s game. Eager to get out of this loophole, Duncan secretly set a performance at the Town Hall. Here, Duncan performed some old songs he had written, including Snake of Modum, and some new ones he had written, including “The Big Boss”, a song directed towards Winston. It didn’t take long for action to be taken against him. Secretly knowing he would be there, Ugo Vondez sent police officers to the Alpine Disco Nightclub and arrested Duncan on the possession of Bloxy Cola. Shortly after this, Winston Hass made claims that he was dropping Duncan from the company.</p><p><strong>Tempo Riot</strong></p><p>Four days after his arrest, Duncan was bailed out of prison by a man named Benjamin Visser, who claimed to be Duncan’s uncle. After leaving the jail, Benjamin revealed himself to be Nicholas Sasmeli of the Boisson Cachee. Nicholas then began to make a deal for Duncan. Nicholas would provide Duncan with Bloxy Cola, alongside funds and other supplies, and help Duncan continue performing, if Duncan helped Nicholas and the Boisson Cachee get rid of the ban against Bloxy Cola. Duncan agreed to do this, but on the extra term that Nicholas help Duncan get together a team in order to provide extra support for setting up his performances. Nicholas agreed to the extra term. Duncan decided to hire Oliver Prins Jr., the man who beforewards got Bloxy Cola to Duncan, to be the smuggler for the team (under the condition that he stopped stealing Bloxy Cola from the Boisson Cachee, which he agreed to, even though he wouldn’t need to do it anymore after joining the team). Nicholas, meanwhile, ended up using his role as a detective to bail out three prisoners recently locked within jail to help him. Nicholas gathered Ian Ruis, a technical expert who had been imprisoned for shutting down the power grid of half the city, Peter Smits, a graffiti artist imprisoned for spray-painting “Freedom of Speech” on the back of the Town Hall shortly after Duncan’s performance, and Jacob Meer, a skilled musician arrested for, like Duncan, the illegal possession of Bloxy Cola. Nicholas also gave all 5 of them nicknames, naming Duncan “Truthspeaker”, Oliver “Prince Ollie II”, Ian “S10RM”, Peter “Mr. Graffiti”, and Jacob “Amadeus”. Nicholas would plan out the time and location of the performances, as well as keep police occupied in the meanwhile, Duncan would write the songs and perform them at the time and place, Oliver would steal the supplies Nicholas could not get a hold of, Ian would hack the power grid to manage the electrical appliances, Peter would spray paint across the city promoting the performances, and Jacob would create all the instrumental music for the songs. Together, the six of them formed the group Tempo Riot (although it was only advertised to have five members, leaving Nicholas out of the list, under his own jurisdiction), and slowly, they became one of the biggest (and most infamous) Rhythm Star music groups in Modum City, gaining the attention of everyone in the city whenever they held a performance.</p></div>
