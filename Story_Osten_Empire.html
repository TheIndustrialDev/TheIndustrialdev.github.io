            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>The Rise of the Osten's</strong></p><p>The story is set within the mythical medieval world of Haus. This world of Haus is powered by an ancient magic known as the Heilig force; however, this was an art only practiced by wizards at the time, which there were very few in number. The story begins within the year 891 during a large war known as The War for the Holy Uralt. King Cody Stark III, who was the leader of a powerful kingdom in the Southern end of the world known as the Sud Kingdom (named after its founder, King Sud), had engaged within conflicts between the three other kingdoms of the world: the Osten State to the East, the Recht Kingdom to the West, and the Gofroren Nation to the North. All four of the kingdoms were in desire to take control of the Ancient kingdom of Uralt, which was believed to have unimaginable wealth stored within it, hidden underneath the area southeast of the 4 kingdoms. For five years, these kingdoms battled it out in several different battles, wiping their citizens out one after another. Eventually, the Osten States took down the Gofronen and Recht in the Battles of Red Stone Hill and Saint Mark Island, leaving only the Sud Kingdom and the Osten State, led by legendary sword fighter King Trevor Bose, remaining in power. In order to gain the final hand, Stark III decided to unleash a final plain to defeat the Kingdom of Osten State.</p><p><strong>The Stark's Victory</strong></p><p>Two weeks after the fall of the Recht Kingdom, Stark III secretly sent his soldiers into the Ancient Kingdom of Uralt and transported all of the gold, jewels, and relics found within the kingdom. A huge battle broke out between the two groups, resulting in more bloodshed than any other battle that had ensued during the war. Despite King Cody Stark III’s best efforts, he was eventually beaten by King Bose of the Osten’s, forcing Sud and his army to retreat. Osten had claimed their control over the ancient kingdom, and the remaining forces of their army entered the Kingdom to gaze upon their reward. However, much to his dismay, King Bose and his army found very little relics or prizes except for a few golden coins and jewels left behind by Stark’s forces. While they were all searching for more artifacts, Stark, with the help of an unnamed wizard, sealed the doors to the ancient kingdom, locking King Bose and the Osten forces inside the kingdom forever. Shortly afterwards, King Stark III took over the Osten Kingdom, as well as whatever remained of the Gofrenen and Recht kingdoms. Eventually, King Stark III decided to rename the area Stark Kingdom, and designed the monarchy kingdom in his image. This kingdom ended up surviving for nearly 300 years without any disaster occurring. However, one day, that all changed.</p><p><strong>Joseph Harp</strong></p><p>The story takes place in the year 1073. The Stark Kingdom has since grown into a size larger than any other kingdom in history, and has been renamed the Starken Empire. The story tells of a man living within the town of Berg by the name of Joseph Harp. Joseph had taken up an interest in the art of the Heilig force ever since he was a little child. Now, at the age of 23, he believes he is ready to begin practicing the arts. However, in order to start such a journey of learning the arts, he first needs to find a wizard. The player controls Joseph as he goes around Berg asking people for any knowledge of the wizard. Eventually, the citizens tell him of the location of Zauberer, an old wizard living within the mountains that Uralt Kingdom is found within. Upon reaching Zauberer, Joseph is tasked with performing a series of trials for Zauberer to prove he is worthy of the wizard’s time. During said trials, Joseph finds himself upon the ancient kingdom of Uralt, but finds the entrance still sealed shut. Zauberer warns Joseph not to go near the Kingdom, as the spirits of the Osten State still possess it.</p><p><strong>The Osten's Unleashed</strong></p><p>Over the next few weeks, Zauberer trains Joseph the basic principles of the Heilig force, and all the different abilities one can achieve with it. At first, Joseph finds it particularly different to do; however, over time, Joseph gets the hang of it. One day, Joseph ended up stumbling upon the kingdom again while on his way through the mountains. During this time, Joseph felt he heard cries for help coming from inside the Kingdom. Despite knowing of how the Osten State’s spirits still lingered within the kingdom, Joseph secretly walked towards the Kingdom. The closer he got to the Kingdom, the louder the cries appeared to get. Upon reaching the doors of Uralt, Joseph attempted to use the Heilig force to open the door. After multiple failing attempts, to his own surprise, Joseph managed to remove the seal from the doors and enter the Kingdom. At first, Joseph was horrified by the amount of skeletons found within the kingdom. Eventually, while walking throughout the kingdom, Joseph found a strange, glowing red stone within the center chamber. Upon grabbing it, one of the skeletons in front of Joseph slowly turned into a normal looking human being with his eyes shut. Upon opening his eyes, they appeared to be glowing red. The corpse revealed himself to be King Bose of the Osten State, and proceeded to get into a sword fight with Joseph. Regardless of how much damage the player does to Bose, the player will always be defeated, and the jewel will be stolen from Joseph. Upon receiving the jewel, Bose attaches it to his own sword, and as if instantaneously, the remaining skeletons surrounding Bose begin turning into undead beings just like Bose. Joseph proceeds to run through the main hall and escape the chamber as he uses his Heilig force to attack the approaching soldiers. Before making it out of the kingdom, Joseph is surrounded by Bose and more undead soldiers. Right before Bose is able to kill him, Zauberer enters the kingdom and takes out the soldiers surrounding Bose. Bose recognizes Zauberer and reveals him to be the wizard that sealed the doors in the first place. Bose and Zauberer then engage into a climactic battle, during which Bose slashes off Zauberer’s left arm. However, Joseph manages to attack Bose using the Heilig force and get Zauberer out of the kingdom. This then leads to Bose escaping the kingdom himself, but instead of chasing after Joseph and Zauberer, who run away from their army towards Northern Stark, Bose makes his way towards the kingdom of Stark.</p><p><strong>The Osten State</strong></p><p>This marks the very beginning of actual RPG portion of the game. The game jumps ahead to 1076, 3 years after the events of the first game. All but the Northern portion of Stark kingdom have been destroyed and rebuilt by King Bose and the Osten State. Knowing that all of this was their fault, the leader of the town, Derek Konig, gets Joseph and Zauberer to help them defend their city against the approaching armies of Bose. During the battle, however, Zauberer is killed by General Nicholas Pike, who the player kills after witnessing the murder. After the climactic battle ends with the city surviving the onslaught, Joseph learns of a force of resistance fighters within Southern Osten State, which are planning on taking down Bose once and for all. In response, Joseph alone leaves the city in order to pursue these resistance fighters. Throughout the game, the player will have the freedom of choosing where on the map they wish to go, just like an RPG game. Along the way, the player will go through various different regions, towns, forts, and castle cities based on which areas they find themselves within. Along the way, players will have to kill off several different varieties of warriors found within the regions. Players will also gain access to special weaponry, each one depending on whatever region the player finds themselves in. For every weapon, the player can upgrade it in some fashion. As well, players will also be able to learn different Heilig powers (such as controlling the wind or increasing their weapons damage or turning their enemies into personal fighters…well…typical magic stuff) to increase their odds of survival. The NPC’s of each region will also be able to issue the player side quests in order to earn weaponry, in-game currency, and many other rewards. During the journey, players will encounter sparse rogue resistance fighters, who will help the player in specific missions.</p><p><strong>The Stark Resistance</strong></p><p>Upon arriving in the Southern most territory, players will finally run into the main hideout of the resistance fighters. Joseph will then meet with the leader of the fighters, Louis Barcel, who views the players fighting skills and declares him one of their most powerful fighters. The player will then be forced to fight missions for the resistance fighters in order to take out specific targets of the Osten Empire. Eventually, the Osten’s will find the hideout the resistance fighters are using, and will plan an all-out attack on the hideout using all of their forces. The player goes through several missions throughout southern Osten to help prepare for the battle. Eventually, the army will approach the hideout of the fighters and the final battle will begin. In the start of the battle, the player fights enemies near the front of the hideout in an attempt to avoid them from breaking in. However, regardless of how many soldiers the player kills, they will always break into the hideout and begin massacring the resistance. Joseph then fights his way throughout the city in an attempt to reach the headquarters of the resistance. Upon arriving in the headquarters, Joseph arrives just in time to find Bose killing Louis Barcel using the sword he used to chop off Zauberer’s arm, following with Joseph resurrecting moments later. After realizing that Joseph witnessed the murder, Bose will begin the final battle and attempt to kill Joseph. Using all of the weaponry and Heilig magic the player has learned throughout the game, the player must damage Bose to the point where he falls to the ground and is unable to fight anymore. The player remembers that the jewel is what Bose used to resurrect all the Osten soldiers and attempts to destroy it: however, the player learns from Bose the stone is unbreakable and the resurrection can never be undone. In response, Joseph grabs the sword and decapitates Bose in revenge for Zauberer. This leads to the resistance fighters finally killing off the Osten soldiers located within the hideout. After the battle is over, the resistance fighters declare Joseph the leader of the resistance (as there are still Osten soldiers around the kingdom), and the player is now able to use the Blade of Trevor Bose in combat. As well, enemies now get stronger, and players are able to access specific in-game areas inaccessible prior to the game ending. This leaves players with stuff to do after the game is over.</p></div>
