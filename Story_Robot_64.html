            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>Dr. Navet</strong></p><p>The world begins within the world of Avenir in the year 2021. Avenir is quite similar to the world we live within on Earth, with a few minor changes. In this world, there is a scientist living in the middle of the wilderness by the name of Dr. Tim Navet. Dr. Navet was born in the year 1953 in the small town of Toddville. Ever since he was a little boy, Tim Navet had been obsessed with creating new things. This obsession eventually led to him becoming one of the smartest individuals of his age, spending all of his time studying several different fields of sciences and mathematics in order to invent machines other people thought were simply relics of the future, including the first prototype Jetpack in 1982. However, this obsession came with a cost, as Tim was particularly lonely throughout his life due to him practically living within his basement, and even when Tim WASN’T living within his basement, everyone around him would be such a low intellect level compared to him that they would have no idea what he was talking about (that or they didn’t much care). In the year 2001, Tim moved to the big city of Blamopolis. Although the resources he could use towards his inventions was much greater than before, Tim was so used to the loneliness of his home basement that he ended up collecting over time the fear of open spaces (Agoraphobia).</p><p><strong>Beepo's Creation</strong></p><p>Unable to live with the big open city of Blamopolis, Tim was slowly being driven to insanity. One day, while working in BribbleCo Laboratories, Tim accidentally blew up one of his inventions, resulting in the death of one on his coworkers, Oscar Blorange. It was at this moment that Tim declared that he could no longer live around so many people. Tim collected all of his inventions, sold his house, and moved out to a lot of land in the Vedro forest. There, Tim used all of his resources to create a place perfect for him to call home, including a treehouse and an underground vault, where he held all of his inventions he ever made to avoid them getting in harms way. However, Tim still felt extremely lonely while living in his new home. He wanted to live with someone who could understand him better than anyone else could, but also would not mind his standards of living. Incapable of forming friendship with any real person in the world, Tim decided to do the one thing he was best at: use his inventing skills to create a friend perfect for him. Over the next 7 years, Tim spent all of his time trying invent a sophisticated robot that he would eventually call his first friend. Then, in 2010, that dream became real. After 7 years of hard work, Tim had finally finished the robot. However, he soon realized that, despite the fact that it could regenerate power, his new robot would need a surprisingly large amount of initial power to operate him. So, to solve this problem, Tim simply placed his robot up on the roof of his treehouse and waited for a storm to come. When said storm DID come, a lightning bolt struck the robot, generating the power needed to operate him. Tim quickly came to realize he had created the first artificial fully-sentient robot in the world. And thus, Tim had decided to name him Beepo (since he was a robot).</p><p><strong>Beebo's Creation</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that they were in no way human, Beepo acted almost exactly like a normal human kid. The only thing that separated him from a normal human being is that Beepo A: was a robot, and B: tended to eat nothing but candy and ice cream due to not having the ability of gaining weight as humans do from eating too much. This led to Tim seeing Beepo more as like a son he never had than a friend he had never received. However, Tim was not always capable of hanging out and playing with Beepo due to his life as an inventor. This led to Beepo always complaining about being particularly lonely and never having anyone to play with. Feeling bad for Beepo, Tim decided to create a friend just like him in order to keep him company. This time, the robot only took 6 months to make, and was powered in a way similar to Beepo, via a lightning shock. Tim decided to name this new robot Beebo. However, Tim realized that due to them looking extremely similar, Tim found it hard to distinguish them from one another. Therefore, to solve the problem, Tim decided to give Beepo outfits that had the number 1 on them, and Beebo outfits that had the number 2. And for a while, they lived quite peacefully. That is until, however, one of Tim’s inventions changed them forever.</p><p><strong>Tim's Virtual Reality</strong></p><p>The year is 2019. Tim at this current moment is 68 years old at this current moment, and he is afraid that eventually, he is going to die. Tim also worries that when he does die, Beepo and Beebo are going to be left in the world without him to guide them throughout their lives. Worried about Beepo and Beebo experiencing the same loneliness he had lived for most of his life, Tim decided to do something about it. Very recently, special “Virtual Reality” technology had been invented in order to allow players of games to teleport into the game’s world as if they were living within the game. Tim wanted to take this to the next level by transmitting himself into the virtual world, to a place where he would never be alone and he would always have people to talk to that would understand him, to live forever. Tim spent the next two years of his life developing said world on his computer, using his own memories to dictate how life in this new virtual realm was like, even creating a small version of the very home in which they live in. Finally, after 2 years, in 2021, the world was finally, in his vision, complete. However, success was not entirely imminent. Although the world itself was created, Tim did not immediately find a way to get into it. Tim tried model after model after model of headsets to send him into the world, but none of them worked. Tim thought all was lost…but things were just getting started.</p><p><strong>Beepo's Entrapment</strong></p><p>Interested in the new “invention”, Beepo inserted a USB cord connecting to him into the computer. Suddenly, Beepo’s conscious was sent into the virtual world, and his actual body in real life went offline. This also happened to corrupt most of the files within the virtual world, making Tim unable to access them. Tim suddenly became desperate to find a way to get Beepo out of the virtual world. However, he soon began to realize he could not find Beepo within the virtual world, neither through exploring it nor searching through the game’s corrupted files. Tim began to lose hope and fear that Beepo was lost forever. Beebo was the only one who would be able to access the world to find out what happened to Beepo, but Tim was hesitant on letting him into the world to find him as well. However, eventually Tim allows Beebo in order to make this journey, but not before updating his software to allow Tim to communicate with him in the virtual world from the real world. And this is where our story begins.</p><p><strong>Venturing in the VR</strong></p><p>The world covers the story of Beebo, the second robot created by Tim as a friend for Beepo, who is the only one capable of going through the virtual world in search of him. Tim, the inventor of Beepo and Beebo, contacts Beebo throughout his journey, essentially acting as his guide throughout the game. The ice cream and candy the player collects throughout the game represent the favorite foods of Beepo, the one the player is trying to save. All of the world throughout the game, including the city, ocean, and many other regions of the map, all are fragmented memories of places Tim has been before, which he will point out as the game goes on. Most of the items the player uses in the game, such as the jetpack, are all inventions created by Tim Navet. The enemies in the game are versions of pieces of bad memories Tim had when he was of a younger age. Essentially, the entire world is created by Tim as a remembrance of his past, mostly his childhood, which the player learns as they go on throughout the game.</p><p><strong>The Reunion</strong></p><p>After going through 75% of the game, the player will finally find and encounter Beepo. However, they will have to face some enemies in order to finally reach him. Upon defeating said enemies and encountering Beepo, Beebo and Beepo attempt to escape. However, the player will discover that a hidden virus within the world is preventing them from leaving. Tim begins to realize that this is why all of the files were corrupted once Beepo entered the virtual world. After gaining said knowledge, the characters are faced with a new goal: to eradicate the virus and escape the world before it becomes destroyed. Throughout the next 25% of the game, Beepo will follow the help the player. Essentially, they will act as a Luigi type character, assisting the player in fighting enemies, making their way past certain points of the map, ect ect ect. As they go on throughout the rest of the game, the player will begin to recognize the virus’ effect on the world in more detail, seeing everything start to slowly corrupt, and eventually disappear entirely in some cases.</p><p><strong>Beepo's Rescue</strong></p><p>Upon almost reaching the end of the game, the player will lose contact with Dr. Tim for reasons they will not yet know. Upon reaching this point, Beebo and Beepo will be forced to continue on their journey without his help…for some time. Soon, the player will reach the end of the game, where they find the recreation of their home in the real world completely corrupted. This is also, ironically, where the source of the virus is. Beepo and Beebo are forced to fight out a bunch of corrupted enemies in order to make their way to the heart of the virus. Eventually, it will appear as though the two will be overwhelmed by the virus. However, in the middle of the fight, Tim will show up and start helping them kill off the enemies, revealing that he found a way to bring his full self into the virtual world. Tim begins to comment on how much the two robots have changed ever since they were locked in the virtual world (kind of like how a parent sees a kid as having grown up so fast) and is thankful to have finally done something with his life. Eventually, Tim finds a way for them to escape the virtual world, but as they are attempting to escape, the Virus begins to corrupt the gateway, trying to avoid them from leaving. In a final attempt to save Beebo and Beepo, Tim makes a sacrifice, flying himself using a jetpack into the heart of the Virus in order to destroy it forever. Upon entering the heart, the virus itself is destroyed in an explosion-like cinematic, forcing the robots out of the virtual world. Upon reemerging in real life, the robots find Tim dead, smiling while lying on his bed. On his desk, the robots find a golden key. Using said key, they walk on down to a locked door which they assumed was a basement, but in reality was the vault Tim had stored his inventions in. Upon finding all of these inventions and relics Tim had hidden for so long, the robots agree to work on Tim’s inventions and fulfill his dream of being an inventor and complete his works in his honor.</p></div>
