            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>The Factory Is Built</strong></p><p>The story begins in a small town known as Brookslinville in Tennessee. There was an orphan living within the city known as Marcus Westfield. Marcus was the owner of a small typewriter company within the center of the city. Marcus’ business ended up growing highly successful due to its convenient location, and eventually became the most profitable typewriter company in the town. As the city grew in size and population, Marcus felt the need to expand his business. As a result, in 1888, he had hired a team of manufacturers to build him a factory capable of producing the ink and the machines necessary to create his typewriters. Marcus was extremely determined to build the factory in his image to maximize his profits and his likings. It wasn’t until three years later in 1891, however, that the factory had actually been finished. For the first 4 years, the company was a huge success. Marcus was selling typewriters to companies and individuals all across the state, and eventually build another facility in South Carolina to spread word of his business. However, in the year 1895, Marcus’ Inc. was starting to get outperformed by rival companies, whose typewriters were lasting much longer than theirs. Marcus was desperate to get his company back on track. However, by 1897, barely anyone was buying his products. It was this very year that Marcus officially decided to close down the company. On July 22nd, Marcus shut down all facilities and sent all his workers home. Marcus had been last seen talking to one of his closest friends outside the main factory, and then shutting the doors from the inside.</p><p><strong>The Factory Is Alive?</strong></p><p>For 5 years, nobody heard a word about Marcus. Nobody ever saw him, nobody heard of him, and with no family looking for him, he slowly became a distant thought of memory. Some individuals claimed he still was within the factory, and every now and then they heard him speaking to himself, but most turned down these “rumors”. Locals had begun to discuss whether the factory should be taken down. Then, as if out of nowhere, in 1902, Marcus Inc. started flooding the markets with all different kinds of products: not just typewriters, but carpets, lightbulbs, toys, books, tools, guns: anything and everything one could think of. The products were not much of a success, though, as most items broke within 2 months of purchase. However, whenever individuals attempted to gaze upon the factory, they were met by a completely abandoned appearing facility. They saw no machines, no vehicles, and no people. In fact, they could barely see much of anything, as most of the doors were locked shut and the windows boarded up. People began to question where all their products were being made of, as they were no records of any Marcus Inc. facilities being made in other states, and the factory in South Carolina had already been demolished in 1900. Then, in 1903, scary things began to occur.</p><p><strong>The Start of the Murders</strong></p><p>On March 18th 1903, a group of 5 past workers managed to, during the night, break into the factory in an attempt to see what was inside and potentially find Marcus. However, they were never observed coming out of the factory. Many people wondered whether their disappearances could have been the same scenario as Marcus’ and they would eventually escape. However, things did not go according to plan. On April 18th, one of the workers, Frederick Korschkev, who had been missing for a month, was found dead inside of his own home hanging from the ceiling. His widow, Marissa Korschkev, claimed she had nothing to do with the body, which led to all the more confusion. Frederick had looked completely different from when he went in: his arms were scratched up, his left hand was completely missing, and even his eyes appeared to be stabbed out. However, the darkest part of this corpse was a strange symbol etched on his back. Upon investigation, it was found to be a sideways Scorpio symbol (as he was born on October 29th), which looked exactly like an M when turned, his first initial.</p><p><strong>The Case Opens</strong></p><p>The people of Brookslinville were terrified at this sight. However, they barely had enough time to react. The next 4 days, each body ended up reappearing one by one in their houses, each one with their eyes stabbed out and the symbols marked in them. Believing the cases to be heavily intriguing, a detective by the name of Marlow Gendry began investigating the murders. This eventually led him up to the requirement of entering the factory himself. After debating it for weeks, Marlow entered the factory on August 19th, 1905. Before entering the facility, Marlow informed citizens that he most likely would never return. And that prediction was correct: Marlow was never witnessed coming out of the facility. However, on September 19th, 1905, no corpse was ever discovered of Marlow in his home. His body, instead, would be located at the actual factory itself. It wasn’t discovered for weeks, as nobody dare wanted to go near the factory. One man, however, was brave enough to go on the area surrounding it, and they eventually found his body. This man just so happened to be Patrick Undale (the character the player takes control of), Marlow’s partner who he was training. Patrick had been investigating a murder through the city and has decided to stop at the factory on his way to work. Upon investigating the body, Patrick found similarities to other victims, such as the gouging of the eyes and the symbol on his back. However, Patrick noticed a detail that heavily intrigued him. Inside of Marlow’s jacket, Patrick found a small notebook. This heavily frightened Patrick, as Marlow had never been known to own pocketbooks in his life. Upon opening the book, Patrick found most of it empty, except for a few drawings that appeared to have been drawn by Marlow. These drawings depicted very creepy imagery inside the factory, including very rusty machinery covered in blood, desks with smiles etched onto them, and even the an executive office which had been completely demolished and a pentagram in blood drawn on the floor. Patrick decided to lay low for some time, working further in his current murder case.</p><p><strong>He is coming...</strong></p><p>As the weeks went by, Patrick began hearing faint whispers while he was alone. This frightened Patrick at first, but eventually he got used to it. Patrick was even heard at times communicating with the whispers, which frightened the people overhearing him from time to time. However, one day, Patrick’s wife, Sophia, ended up getting in a car accident. She died in the hospital three days later, on November 6th, 1905. After the event, Patrick found that the accident had gouged out Sophia’s eyes. Frightened by this, Patrick looked at the back of Sophia, and found the very same symbol that had been on Marlow’s and the rest of the worker’s backs. Following this moment, the whispers in Patrick’s head grew louder and louder. This drove Marcus to insanity, and on December 14th, 1905, Patrick burned the pocketbook he found in Marlow’s jacket. For one month, Patrick stopped hearing the whispers and he slowly turned back to normal. However, on January 14th, 1906, Patrick was asked to come to Rodriguez prison in order to view a murder that had occurred in the prison. Upon entering the cell of Namek Yarslow, the murdered prisoner who happened to once work for Marcus, he found the word Patrick written in blood on the wall. Patrick found the prisoner’s eyes gouged out as well. However, upon turning over the criminal’s body, Patrick found not only the symbol, but also the very diary he had burned stabbed into the back of the criminal as if completely unburnt. However, Patrick found the word’s “He is coming” etched on the front cover. Upon opening the pocketbook, which originally was empty, Patrick found symbols written on a majority of pages (except those Marlow had drawn on), appearing as a completely unknown language, written completely in blood.</p><p><strong>Nothing Left To Lose</strong></p><p>Patrick decided he could avoid this no longer. Patrick needed to enter the factory and find out what on Earth was going on. However, upon asking his boss permission to enter the factory, he was denied, stating that it was too dangerous. Over the weeks, Patrick asked over and over and over again to enter, and each time he was denied. And with every day, Patrick began to hear more whispers, and they got louder and louder. Patrick soon decided that this was a task he would have to complete on his own. Patrick had to find out what had occurred with Marlow, why Marcus targeted his wife, what was written in the pocketbook, and where Marcus truly was. However, before Marcus could begin his plans, his very boss was murdered in the same way the rest of Marcus’ victims had been. However, etched on his boss’ chest was the word “Patrick”, which led to many suspecting Patrick was the killer. Patrick ended up going on the run, and within a week, Patrick had lost everything. With nothing left to lose and his sanity slowly draining away, Patrick decided it was time for him to enter the factory. The game begins with Patrick walking up front to the factory doors, ready to make his final push into the building.</p></div>
