            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>D.Va</strong><div>Don’t let their typical appearance as a killing machine fool you. That’s the mech’s job. Outside the battlefield, D.Va is actually a pretty relaxed person. Killing chickens for eggs is no exception. However, it does always help to have a giant mech robot shooting huge railguns to completely obliterate your targets in a violent and decimating way do the work for you.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Queen Elsa</strong></div><div>Winter was coming, and yes, it is Elsa’s doing again. After accidentally freezing the entire chicken population, Elsa decided to make it up to the villagers and get them the eggs they needed. To do this, Elsa signed up with the Egg Farm. Her freezing powers makes damaging the chickens so much easier…well, for her anyway.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Michael Jackson</strong></div><div>Michael was always a hit, and he brought all the fans with him…unfortunately, some of these fans were undead. Fortunately, these undead were very exploitable, as they could be bribed away with chicken. Fascinated, Michael gathered all the chicken he could to feed the zombies. However, they slowly ran out of it. Eager for more, Michael contacted the Egg Farm for help. And, like the smooth criminal he is, Michael easily struck the minds of the company with his fanatic moves and his undead coworkers.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Joker</strong></div><div>The Joker and the Penguin did not have very good relations. Whenever the Joker had planned a mass scheme in Gotham, the Penguin, and his…well…penguins, always somehow managed to get in the way and mess up his plan. The Joker needed a way to get payback at the Penguin and his penguins. Then, Joker was mysteriously contacted by the Egg Farm. Knowing the Penguin’s sympathy for flightless birds, the Joker knew that this was a perfect revenge tactic. And thus, the Joker was in business.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Annie</strong></div><div>Don’t let Annie’s appearance as a youngster discourage you. As young as she may appear, Annie is actually a fierce fighter to mess with. This is especially the case while she is with her teddy bear, Tibbets. Sure, it may be strange for someone along the lines of her to be doing something like killing chickens. But hey; it’s all the same to her. Just…don’t get her mad. No like, seriously; don’t get her mad. Not joking.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The Flash</strong></div><div>The Flash has always been using his speed powers to his advantage. However, his constant loop of catching criminals was getting boring after a while. So, the Flash got the random thought; why not use his powers for recreational purposes? We’re not sure why he chose of all things to kill chickens, but hey; you do you, man.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Antman</strong></div><div>Antman has been, and always will be, a thief. However, being a thief doesn’t ALWAYS work out. Turns out Antman sucks at stealing eggs, and as a result got captured as a result. Antman was given two choices; serve his prison sentence, or go temporarily live on the Egg Farm to help produce more of their eggs. It’s kind of obvious what Antman would choose in such a scenario…prison, but he was later forced.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Shrek</strong></div><div>All the tourism going into Shrek’s swamp was driving him insane. And behold, Donkey wasn’t very much of a help either. Rather than punch a bunch of holes in his house, Shrek decided what he needed to do was take a vacation. Going into town, Shrek heard of the Egg Farm hiring for their egg production business. Shrek instantly signed up to get the peace he desired. Killing chickens, however, is a lot less peaceful than he thought.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Deadpool</strong></div><div>The merc with a mouth has always had a thing for killing. However, recently, that business has not been doing him well. Competition with the other mercenaries resulted in not many targets being left to kill. As a result, Deadpool looked for a new job doing what he does best. And, behold, he found one; however, it was a job killing chickens rather than humans. Deadpool, however, didn’t care; so long as he was killing something, he’s fine. Why? He’s Deadpool. That’s why.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Private Ryan</strong></div><div>The World War was a very challenging time for Ryan. However, after the war, he decided he wanted to follow a simpler lifestyle. Ryan went to every local newspaper, searching through all the ads to find whichever job would best suit him. Finally, he found a job for a company known as the Egg Farm. Feeling the job would be an easy one for him, he accepted it. Little did he know what the job involves; killing stuff. Typical.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>James Bond</strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Bond, James Bond, is on a mission. The Egg Farm has been getting extreme amounts of profit lately. Why? No reason. How? By selling eggs, they claim. But is what they claim what they truly mean? Yes, but nobody else believes that. Bond has been sent in by the MI6 in order to discover just what was making the business so popular. Boy, is he about to be disappointed.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Master Pai Mei</strong></div><div>Kung Fu is one of the most popular arts in the world, and it is only truly mastered by the rare few. This, however, doesn’t do well against chickens…apparently. Recently, Pai Mei’s dojo was raided by a huge flock of chickens. The chickens cost Pai Mei a lot of money. Pai Mei was certain he needed to get revenge. The rest is history…and kind of brutal…on the chicken’s part though.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Beowulf</strong></div><div>It is always fun to be the king of a massive kingdom. However, sometimes, governing gets boring, and you need to lay low for a while. What’s the best way for Beowulf to lay low? Kill dragons. However, there isn’t necessarily many dragons around nowadays. So, Beowulf gets the next best thing; chickens. Both got wings, so it counts.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Tarzan</strong></div><div>Tarzan has learned many things from his time living in the jungle. One of these, however, was not what a chicken was. They began to get introduced into his jungle by explorers, and he was mesmerized by them. This, however, was until they began to eat up most of the plant life. Terrified by this, Tarzan became eager to learn more of these creatures. So, he went to the Egg Farm to learn their weaknesses. It’s some time away from the jungle, but to him, it’s worth it to protect it from what he calls “The peckers”.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Bacon Hair</strong></div><div>Bacon Hair has always been a chicken farmer. The rest of society outcasts his noobish-style character, so he spends his days quietly farming. The one thing nobody understands, though, is why he farms with chickens. I mean, he is literally bacon hair. Why not farm pigs? They make bacon, not chickens. Nobody knows the answer, and nobody probably will. The answer lies hidden in his strange, honestly creepy smile.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Robin Hood</strong></div><div>A true, skilled hunter will sit for hours to catch a single target. Waiting ever so patiently for the beast to enter his sights, only to fall into the crosshairs of his maker. Robin, however, does not match this personality. Robin hates waiting around, and wants his prize to come to him. But alas, to do that, he must first come to it. On an egg farm. In the middle of the ocean. What’s he even here for again? Idk…
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Spartacus</strong></div><div>Living in the Roman Empire’s time has its perks. One of them is being great swordsmen. Another is getting to wear fancy capes. Another is fighting with the warrior of the heart against the Romans for your freedom. Another is teleporting into the future and killing eggs for money. We know that last one doesn’t make sense to you, and neither does it to Spartacus. That doesn’t matter though. Why? Because it’s the Roman era, that’s why!
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Mozart</strong></div><div>Mozart always knew his music attracted the crowds. However, chickens weren’t exactly the crowds he was looking for. Recently, Mozart has seen massive flocks of chicken run his way whenever he performs. He isn’t sure why, but the people seem to like his music and find this funny. So, Mozart decided to begin playing at the Egg Farm. Who knows; maybe the chickens will swim across the ocean to reach him? You never know with these guys.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Joan of Arc</strong></div><div>Being the strongest female knight in France can be a tantalizing job. Sometimes, you just need a vacation from fighting for the homeland. Joan heard of a great place in the ocean known as the Egg Farm where she could travel to. Needing a break, but not having much options, she agreed. Although killing chickens for eggs wasn’t necessarily what she had in mind, she’s find with it; it’s better than killing the enemies of France all day…unless the chickens were enemies of France. In that case, it’s all the same to her.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Julius Caesar</strong></div><div>Being the emperor of Rome is a powerful job. Sometimes, it can even be used for the most practical of jobs. Once, Caesar found a flock of chickens roaming around his palace. He managed to capture one and eat one of its eggs. Caesar was so delighted by the taste that he ordered more be captured, so he could eat more eggs. After learning there was an island fully dedicated off of harvesting eggs, Caesar found it so hard to believe that he decided to take a trip to the island himself: needless to say, he was pleased.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Mikasa Ackerman</strong></div><div>When it comes to fighting titans, nobody is better than Mikasa. When it comes to fighting chickens, however, that’s not exactly her expertise. But, alas, the city was low on food, and nowhere around the Last City was deemed safe enough for farmers. So, Mikasa was sent to find more deemable places for food. She eventually found the Egg Farm, and so, deciding to use her talents for something OTHER than titan killing, she took up a job there. Who knows; maybe the chickens will turn into titans? Eh; I doubt it.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>V</strong></div><div>V for Vendetta is his name. Virtuously, V has quite the Vendetta for the Vicious Vermin known as Chickens. These chickens have a Very Violent tendency of intending to Vanquish V’s hideout farm, pecking it and then Vanishing from Vision. The Vast Violence that these chickens have Villianously casted upon V, however, is not to be met without Vengeance. To solve his problems, V Verified that the only Votive method V could use was to Vow a war against all of chicken kind. This is why V Voyaged on a Vessel to this “Vermin-Filled” Island; to be Virtually safe from the chickens and end his war Vowed against them.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Hercules</strong></div><div>Chickens are no hydra to a man like Hercules. No amount of chickens could ever challenge Hercules. So why does Hercules decide to slaughter them in mass numbers? Simple really: he’s hungry. A man of that much strength gets really hungry. The food he is given is good, but it’s not enough. Hercules always needs more. But, he needs to work at the same time as well. So, why not kill animals to get eggs, and then eat the animals after? Genius!
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Goku</strong></div><div>They say the louder you scream, the more powerful you get. This isn’t always the case, but it is for Goku. Why? Who cares? Goku is the strongest being possibly in existence, and he only gets stronger. However, killing gods isn’t always on his list of desired tasks. So, what is on Goku’s daily list of things to do other than fighting off extreme powers of evil to protect the face of the Earth and train at the force capacity of a million humans? Apparently it’s killing chickens for eggs.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Wolverine</strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Being hungry is no easy task to deal with. This is especially evident with Wolverine. Living with a society full of other mutants in a large mansion, there isn’t always plenty of food to go around. Good news for Wolvie, though, is that the Egg Farm offered him fried chicken in return for his help collecting their eggs. Now Logan will be able to eat all the chicken he wants while also taking a break from being turned into a living weapon. It’s a win-win for him!</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Loki</strong></div><div>There are a many things in Midgard that confuse the higher beings of Asgard. One of these is the Egg Farm itself. Those in Asgard who knows of its existence, including Loki, find it curious how an island would be fully dedicated to the slaughter of an animal species for the production of their product. However, Loki has also realized Thor’s recent interest in the farm. Interested on how an egg farm could attract the interest of the God of Thunder himself, Loki traveled to Midgard to see for himself.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Dracula</strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Dracula loves chicken blood. Sure, the blood of humans is more plentiful and will probably aid him more in his quest for global domination. However, chicken blood is so much tastier to him. This is why Dracula got really excited when he heard of job openings at the Egg Farm Island. This was basically an unlimited chicken blood source for him. How was Dracula going to turn down such a deal? Simple; he wasn’t.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Iron Man</strong></div><div>Who exactly are the Avengers even avenging anymore? Iron Man isn’t sure, and he needs a break from trying to find out. Thankfully for him, he no longer runs for Stark Industries, so he has all the time in the world. The only question, though, is where will he spend it? Well, he recently saw an ad for a place called Egg Island, so he figured he might as well try there.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Batman</strong></div><div>Fighting crime in Gotham is always Batman’s expertise. Nobody knows the city better than he does. They also know how to get out of prison a lot better than he does, but that’s not the point. Batman occasionally goes outside of the city to fight these criminals. It doesn’t usually occur, but occasionally it does. Recently, Batman heard Joker was seen roaming around Egg Island. Batman knew something was up (there wasn’t, but he knew), so he decided to go there to investigate himself.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong></div><div>Cristiano Ronaldo has a tendency of kicking things. Kicking a soccer ball all the time results in his leg randomly kicking stuff he doesn’t intend to kick. One time, while he was visiting an egg warehouse, he accidentally kicked the shelving units for a massive amount of eggs. In response, the shelving unit fell down, causing all the eggs to fall and break. Cristiano wanted to make it up for the company; so, he volunteered to help out on the island temporarily to make up for all the lost damages. How generous of him.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Astronaut</strong></div><div>Astronauts perform all kinds of experiments up in space. Recently, they have been needing more eggs for their research projects. However, NASA isn’t exactly all that helpful in this situation. It’s just not exactly the typical function of a space research corporation to produce eggs. So, the astronauts decided to find ways to get their own eggs. An astronaut onboard the station heard of Egg Island selling off eggs, so he decided to visit. Directly. Like, out of an actual falling capsule. There was a big landing and everything. It was very interesting. Still not sure how he is sending the eggs up there.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Bruce Lee</strong></div><div>Bruce Lee has traveled to many great places in his past. He has traveled to worldwide dojos, giant cities, he even has went traveling around the world with Master Mai Pei. However, an Egg Island is definitely a new one for him. Bruce heard he had a challenge by the name of “Sensei Chi Ken Eig” on the island the farm is on. Bruce, looking forward to a new challenger, instantly took up the deal. It wasn’t until after he made it to the island, however, that it was actually saying “Sensei Chicken Egg”. Oh well; no going back now, right?
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Percy Jackson</strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Come live at Mount Olympus, they said. It’ll be fun, they said. Well, for the most part, it was. However, they tend to run out of food very quickly. Sure the supply usually comes in fast, but sometimes, it’s not fast enough for Percy. He woke up once to make himself a giant amount of scrambled eggs, but he then realized they were all out of eggs. Thankfully for Percy, he already knew the place to go…somehow. Egg Farm Island surely hasn’t seen Percy before, but they’ve read the books, so they welcomed him in anyhow.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Santa Claus</strong></div><div>Everyone knows the elves make Santa his toys. But nobody asks who makes Santa his food? It’s not like he eats for one day, and then hibernates the rest of the year. He’s gotta get all of the food from somewhere. Well, one of those places happens to be the Egg Island. However, he only allows the most trusty of workers to farm the eggs he needs for himself, his elves, and the rest of the North Pole’s residents. So, when Santa heard there were new folks arriving, he decided to check them out himself.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Tibbers</strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Remember how we said “Don’t let Annie’s young appearance discourage you”? This is part of the reason why. Tibbers is Annie’s teddy bear, and…let’s just say this is not a fella you want to anger. On top of being absolutely massive, he is really strong, seriously ruthless, and can also set himself on fire. All those things combined, and you got yourself a walking, giant tank. Why are these guys even collecting eggs anyhow? Is it a hobby of sorts? We don’t know, but we are also too afraid to ask.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Michael Jordan loves shooting hoops. However, he prefers to shoot them with basketballs. So when he found out that all of his basket balls magically got switched out with giant eggs, he was needless to say a bit confused. He read the label for Egg Farm Island on one of the eggs. He decided he needed a break anyway, so he went on vacation to the island. Who knows; maybe he will find some hidden basketballs on the island? Probably not, but don’t tell him that.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Indiana Jones</strong></div><div>Indiana Jones is no stranger to odd relics. From golden idol heads to crystal skulls, to even the Ark of the Covenant, Indiana Jones knows where the strangest of treasures linger. For some reason, however, he this time is hunting down an egg. Like, legit, just a normal egg. He says it’s on the Egg Farm Island. His allies have asked for photos of the relic, but he refuses, saying it’s too extravagant of a relic for normal eyes to gaze upon. He thinks it’s the treasure of a lifetime. The rest of us think he skipped breakfast this morning and is just hungry.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Noob</strong></div><div>What is it with noobs and chickens? Do they have an obsession behind them? Do they enjoy their taste more than anyone? If they do, this guy evidently is no exception. We hired this guy to help collect eggs, but honestly, he spends most of his time eating the chickens we collect them from. Does he feast upon them hoping to obtain chicken powers? Does he wish to become a Shedletsky-type entity? Is he legit just a chicken fan who forgot his tub of fried chicken at his house? Does he even have a house? Who brought him here? Where did he come from? Why do we have so many questions surrounding this guy? Should we call for help? I feel we probably should.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong></div><div>This is one case nobody would consider elementary. Well, Holmes might, but nobody else sure would. Holmes recently found a diplomat who had gotten poisoned from eating scrambled eggs. Somehow, he traced the eggs made in the pan to the Egg Farm Island. We aren’t sure HOW he managed to do this, but he did. And now, he is headed his way towards the island to investigate himself. He’s probably expecting for some evil villain to be waiting for him there. But no; it’s just egg farmers.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Donald Trump</strong></div><div>Make Chickens Great Again. That’s what Trump always says. We don’t know what it means, but we love it. Trump occasionally likes to take breaks in-between his business, so he goes to private islands occasionally to relax. Recently, he found the Egg Farm Island and wanted to build a resort on it. They gave him a deal; help them produce their eggs, and they will let him build a resort on a nearby island. Obviously, he accepted the deal, and Trump was officially in business.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Thor</strong></div><div>Being the God of Thunder has its uses. For example, Thor can use his thunder to zap the life out of his enemies. This, however, occasionally causes additional problems for Thor. In a recent fight on Earth, Thor accidentally destroyed a warehouse filled with eggs. Thor kind of felt guilty about it despite saving the lives of everyone in the building, and wanted to make it up for them. Thor decided to help out production of the eggs on Egg Island. Ever since then, Thor has for some reason seemed interested in the island, and occasionally goes back there to help out even more than he was supposed to.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>King Midas</strong></div><div>King Midas has a habit of turning things into gold. As a result, he tends to be careful with whatever he touches, placing special clothing and gloves on to prevent him from turning EVERYTHING he touches into gold. One thing he loves turning into gold is eggs, as they are very easy to sell for high amounts of money. Midas only just recently found the Egg Farm Island in the middle of the ocean, and he decided to visit it. What is with kinds and visiting Egg Island? It’s just that good.

</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Captain America</strong></div><div>Captain America. The soldier of the US. The protector of Freedom. The idol of breakfast restaurants. The...wait, the idol of breakfast restaurants? Yep. Captain America loves breakfast restaurants. We aren’t sure of where Cap got this addiction other than his pureblood Americanism. We actually aren’t sure why American’s love breakfast restaurants either. We think it may be the different kind of egg products served there, but we aren’t sure. Either way, we promised Cap all the breakfast food he could obtain if he helped up collect some eggs, so now he is here working with us. That’s America for ya. 
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Albert Einstein</strong></div><div>Nobody truly understands Einstein. People see his theory E=MC^2, and they think it means Energy is Mass times the speed of light. However, this is not the case. The formula actually means Egg = Manpower times Chicken quantity. Why did Albert decide to make a formula for the amount of eggs one could produce? We honestly aren’t sure, but it has helped stabilize the egg production a lot more, and we are able to calculate all Egg productions precisely because of it. As thanks, Albert has permanent permission in order to come to the island whenever he pleases.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Jack Sparrow</strong></div><div>CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow isn’t in such a good spot right now. He was sailing the seven seas as usual when, all of a sudden, he got in a battle with an egg merchant ship. Jack won the battle, of course, but this led him into trouble. A bunch of British ships started to chase after him, and he eventually got caught. They weren’t too happy about the fact that he sunk the egg ship, so now, he is being sent to Egg Island to help production there. Don’t worry; he’ll be escaping…as usual…eventually.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Gordon Ramsay</strong></div><div>If there is one thing Gordon Ramsay knows how to cook, its chicken. As he once told another chef upon being given some chicken, “This chicken is so undercooked, a skilled vet could still save him”. Gordon knows the ins and outs of cooking any animal, and chickens are certainly no exception. And, as you know, eggs come from chickens. So, the Egg Farm gave Gordon a deal; come help collect some eggs, and you’ll have all the chicken your restaurants desire. A contract was signed, some pots and pans were collected, and a business deal was formed.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Old MacDonald</strong></div><div>Old MacDonald had a farm. Notice how we said HAD a farm. That’s because the chickens managed to tear it down eventually. MacDonald then built a new one obviously, but he always wanted to get revenge on the chickens for what they did to him. MacDonald saw the newspaper article asking for help on the Egg Farm Island, and he just couldn’t resist the opportunity. It’s like they always say; revenge is best served eggy…ok nobody ever says that, but you get the idea.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Aang</strong></div><div>Being the Avatar is a hungry business. That and being trapped in an iceberg for 100 years. Aang’s food capacity is basically slim to none; you place an entire buffet in front of him, and he will eat it all almost instantaneously. Now, where do they get all this food from? Many places, but Aang has always been curious on where they get the eggs from. The answer is, as you would expect, Egg Farm Island. Aang is currently traveling there to see how on Earth they make their eggs. Who knows; maybe he can be of some help while he is here…maybe. Just gotta make sure he doesn’t bring the Fire Nation with him.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong></div><div>Just because you are the Queen of a country does not mean you can’t take trips to other places. With the travel systems we have today, Queens and Kings alike can travel anywhere on the world and be back before the day is over. This is the concept behind Queen Elizabeth II heading to the Egg Farm Island. Sure, it isn’t the most practical place to go on a trip to. But hey; the Queen seems to enjoy her time on the island. Maybe she’ll even ask to make it a part of her country! Who knows?
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Medusa</strong></div><div>Turning things to stone is always a handy ability. Whether it revolves around people or animals, anything Medusa stares her eyes into can instantly be turning into a giant stone statue. This is why she was intrigued by the ad for help on the Egg Farm Island. Medusa instantly knew that she could use her stone-gaze ability to her advantage to turn the chickens into stone, thereby speeding up the process. She just has to hope she doesn’t turn any of the other coworkers into stone. THAT wouldn’t be good.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Superman</strong></div><div>Feeding the entire Justice League isn’t an easy task for Superman. Sure, they could just use the Lazarus Pit in order to create chickens over and over again, it doesn’t work fast enough for Superman’s liking. However, Superman is actually in luck. His reporter business recently requested he go to Egg Farm Island in order to check out the activity going on there. Sensing the perfect chance to get all the chicken he wants, he decided to go to the island.
</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Naruto Uzumaki</strong></div><div>Naruto’s multiplication ability can sometimes be annoying to people. He uses it to mess with people all the time whenever he isn’t doing something important. However, at other times, it can be really helpful. For example, beating up chickens. Now we aren’t all that sure why he decided to take up a job on an egg farm of all places. However, what we do know is that his multiplication ability is REALLY helpful. So, we’re gonna keep him around for a while longer.
